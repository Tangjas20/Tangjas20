- 👋 Hi, I’m @Tangjas20 or Jason Tang
- 👀 Currently I'm interested in all sorts of engineering/robotics-related activities whether that be arduino or Raspberry Pi or even ESP32 to an extent (Basically automation).
      I'm also keen in programming, I would like to code in many different languages (Still fairly inexperienced)
      
      
- 🌱 I’m currently studying a Bachelor of Engineering(Hons)(Software)/Commerce(Finance)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on literally anything. If you want to talk or do anything, just shoot me a message

- 📫 How to reach me Lalalala#3187 on Discord, or Tangjas2020Code@gmail.com
